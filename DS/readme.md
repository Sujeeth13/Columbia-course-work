## Important Reminders:
* Ensure you are using **[Go 1.23.1](https://go.dev/dl/#go1.23.1)**! To check your installed version: `go version`.
* Please try to avoid committing large log files - the grading servers only have so much disk space, and too many large log files can prevent your code from being pulled (and graded) correctly.
