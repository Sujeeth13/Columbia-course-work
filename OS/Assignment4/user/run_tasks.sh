# Script to launch a list of tasks
# How it works:
# - Change ourselves to SCHED_FIFO at the highest priority,
#   to ensure we get CPU time to launch all our tasks
# - For each task, launch it as SCHED_FIFO but with a slightly
#   lower priority, to ensure that tasks get an equal chance
#   to set its policy and weight
# - Each task is then responsible to set its own scheduling
#   policy and weight using sched_setscheduler
