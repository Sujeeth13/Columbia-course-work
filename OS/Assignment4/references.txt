Reference List for W4118 Homework

/* include the following statement if you have not referenced anything */
In doing my homework, I certify that I have not used any materials
other than the course textbooks and Linux source code, and I have not
discussed the homework assignment with anyone other than the W4118
instructional staff and, for the team programming portion of the assignment,
my team.

1. https://github.com/iovisor/bpftrace/blob/master/docs/reference_guide.md#2--filtering
  - used for BPF logic

2. Brett Jia (TA): tools/runqlat.bt: CPU scheduler run queue latency as a histogram. Examples.
  - gave advice to look for implementation of run queue latency on the github repo provided in the spec
  - Brett also explained how to use "sudo bpftrace -l" to find all available tracepoints
    - enabled us to find:
      - tracepoint:sched:sched_process_exit
      - tracepoint:sched:sched_wakeup
      - tracepoint:sched:sched_wakeup_new
      - tracepoint:sched:sched_switch

3. https://medium.com/@_piyushjena/a-terse-guide-to-linux-schedulers-part-1-cca87df04d21
    https://medium.com/@_piyushjena/a-terse-guide-to-linux-schedulers-part-2-8668a800824e
  - very useful links for understanding how to setup a scheduling class, and how to setup a scheduling entity. 

4. https://chat.openai.com/
  - used chatgpt for handling git commits 

5. https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/kernel/sched/rt.c#L1697
  - bootlin for tracing load balancing 

6. Office hours with Emma
  - gave insight into where _setscheduler_prio & _setscheduler_params

7. Office hours with Prof Nieh
  - gave insight into guiding FIFO -> RR -> SJF development path 
  - Gave insight into using SJF for max throughput 
  - gave insight into review rt.c for load balancing 

8. Spoke to Brennan:
  - explained concepts of where TIF_NEED_RESCHED flag gets called. 

9. https://edstem.org/us/courses/45654/discussion/
  - referenced Ed for multiple areas including (not changing prios using __normal_prio) 
  - debugging kernel not booting after becoming default 
  - changing kthread to ensure kernel boots 

10. referenced previous homework on how to add elements to a list_head 

11. referenced homework 3 for understanding state changes (part 1) 

12. lectures slides & recordings:
  - how does a scheduler work 
  - using double_lock_balance etc. 
  - fundamentals of load balancing 
  - task_tick, scheduling class, scheduling entity, run queues 

13. Met with Jonothan
  - helped debug a silly error with BUG() in switched_to_oven()
