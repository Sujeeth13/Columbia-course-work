This file should contain:

-	Name & UNI for all group members
-	Homework assignment number
-	How/what each group member contributed to the submission
-	Description for each part

The description should indicate whether your solution for the part is working
or not, the files you modified/added for your solution, and how you tested any
code written for the part.

You may also want to include anything else you would like to communicate to
the grader, such as extra functionality you implemented or how you tried to
fix your non-working code.
